# Exploratory Data Analysis of Olist E-Commerce Orders

An end-to-end data analysis project on the Brazilian Olist e-commerce dataset. This project demonstrates a professional, modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis.

## Project Objective
The goal is to analyze the Olist dataset to derive insights into order fulfillment, delivery performance, and overall operational efficiency. This serves as a portfolio piece to showcase practical data analysis skills.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
*   **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data integrity.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Creating new, insightful columns from existing data (e.g., `delivery_time_days`, `delivery_performance`).
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using statistics and visualizations to uncover patterns and answer business questions.
*   **Data Visualization:** Creating clear and informative plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
*   **Modular Project Structure:** Separating data preparation logic from analysis for a clean, reproducible, and scalable workflow.
*   **Version Control & Documentation:** Using Git/GitHub for version control and maintaining clear documentation in a README.
